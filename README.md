# google-spreadsheet-nextra
A modernized client for accessing and manipulating google sheets

## Credit
- This repo is heavily based on [node-google-spreadsheet](https://github.com/theoephraim/node-google-spreadsheet/) by [theophraim](https://github.com/theoephraim)
- Thanks to [kyranet](https://github.com/kyranet) for some work pre-repo

## What's different from node-google-spreadsheet
1. Modern dependencies with no known security vulnerabilities. (also less of them)
2. Promises api. (no callbacks, yay!)
3. Modernize code (classes over composure, maps over funky arrays with named parameters, ect), and utilize a typescript source.
